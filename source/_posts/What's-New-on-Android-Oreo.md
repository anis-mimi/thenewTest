Google announces Android Oreo with refined notifications, better battery pack lifestyle, updated emoji and the biggest transformation to the foundations of Android to date.

Google offers opened the packet on release 8.0 of its Android operating-system for mobile devices. Oreo succeeds Nougat and Marshmallow, and follows a long-line of candy-themed Android releases.

Timed to coincide with the passing solar eclipse in the US - and prior to the announcement of another raft of Android smartphones from famous brands Samsung and Sony - Oreo brings a large number of enhancements to Google's mobile experience, yet all those expecting a cookie jar filled up with colourful different features could be disappointed.

Nevertheless, beneath the covers is certainly what Google calls the most important change to the foundations of Android OS to date, promising additional users should be able to enjoy Oreo sooner, safer and for longer.

# What's New in Oreo?

Headline features in Android Oreo include better electric battery lifestyle, improved usability, and steps to lessen so-called notification diarrhoea.

 - In-app autofill: previously a common characteristic in browsers, logins to well-known apps is now able to be automatically populated too.
 - Notifications: Discrete dots show up on the part of application icons to reveal the presence of a notification from that app. A long/power press on the icon reveals actionable notifications. Long overdue. Also new is normally notification snoozing and notification categories.
 - Picture-in-photo: continue observing a YouTube video tutorial while looking at email, or check your calendar while on a video chat.
 - Background limits try to hobble battery hogs by imposing limitations on infrequently employed apps.
 - Emoji makeover: over 60 new emoji, with many more redesigned to look more like other systems implementations. Bye bye, blobs.
 - 2 x boot quickness: whatever improves time-to-productivity should be good, but considering that almost all of us tend simply to lock our phones between uses instead of move them off, the benefit here is minor.
 - Smart copy and paste tries to bring a bit more cleverness to the traditionally difficult activity, selecting whole addresses or phone number and suggesting appropriate activities for selected text such as calling, emailing or beginning a map.

# Oreo Roll-out

Google has submitted Google android Oreo to mobile networks and manufacturers for recognition and assessment. At this stage, it's up to them if they choose to force Oreo out via an over the air flow (OTA) update. Many desire it'll be soon, but history might advise patience is required.

However, Google hopes its latest modular architecture, also shipped in Oreo may swiftness this technique. Project Treble, announced just before the Google I/O programmer conference this year, attempts to create rolling out Android better, faster and less expensive.

A new vendor interface today sits between the device-particular vendor implementation code and the Android OS framework code, reducing how much code that should be reworked when a machine is modified to a fresh version of Android.

It's a good idea in theory, but time will tell just how much of a good real-world difference the switch makes to the acceleration of which existing handsets get shiny latest Android releases.
