January 31, 2018 - Zebra Systems Corp. announced the benefits of its Potential of Healthcare: 2022 Medical center Vision Research, revealing the effects of mobile technology work with in acute attention hospitals. The research - which incorporates responses from nursing managers, it (IT) decision-makers and clients - has a perspective from the front-line of patient health care. In addition, it highlights the transformational ability clinical mobility is usually expected to have on global well being services within the next five years.

Zebra's 2022 Hospital Perspective Study identified the growing adoption of clinical flexibility - the usage of mobile units such as for example hand-held mobile computers, tablets, cordless barcode scanners and mobile phone printers -  in hospitals all over the world. Seventy-two percent of surveyed decision-manufacturers say that cellular devices are improving the quality of patient treatment, giving clinicians actionable cleverness at the bedside with the effect of increasing period with clients and reducing errors.

The benefits associated with clinical mobility are fuelling a rise in adoption of mobile technologies at every level of care, according to Zebra. According to survey respondents, practically all hospitals estimate that cellular devices will be used at the bedside by nurses (97 percent) and doctors (98 percent) by 2022, but also increasingly by various other members of the treatment team such as for example pharmacists, lab technicians, radiologists and person transport professionals. The analysis also highlighted how clients perceive the climb of clinical flexibility with nearly eight-in-ten survey respondents feeling positive about mobile equipment being used to improve their care.

Essential survey findings include:

1. Clinical mobility is going to be rapidly starting to be the global regular for individual care: Zebra's 2022 Hospital Vision Study discovered the growing adoption of clinical cellular solutions across all disciplines by 2022. Interestingly, this expansion includes areas where flexibility is already trusted (bedside nurses rising from 65 to 95 percent), in addition to a major boost across other areas such as for example pharmacist and pharmacy technicians (from 42 to 96 percent), laboratory technicians (from 52 to 96 percent) and intensive care nurses (from 38 to 93 percent);

2. Study highlights decrease in preventable errors as essential benefit: Surveyed nursing managers and It again decision-makers expect scientific mobility to lessen errors on areas including medication administration (61 percent) and specimen collection labelling (52 percent);

3. Mobile technology allow clinical personnel to spend more time at a good patient's bedside: By 2022, 91 percent of nurses are anticipated to gain access to electronic health information (EHRs), medical and drug databases (92 percent), and lab diagnostic results (88 percent) using a mobile device, reducing time that must be spent from patients;

4. Communications are expected to improve because of rising clinical flexibility adoption: Nearly Seven-in-10 of surveyed nurse managers credit clinical mobility with bettering staff connection and collaboration along with the quality of person care, while 64 percent of surveyed IT decision-makers identify nurse-to-physician communications due to a high area for improvement;

5. Clinical mobility will be augmented with real-time location information to streamline work-flows: Real-time location systems (RTLS) will be utilized to locate everything from equipment, supplies and pharmaceuticals to affected individuals and staff. This presence will allow administrators to improve bed availability, staff work-flow and safety;

6. Improved data streams included through hand-held mobile technology are expected to improve recognition and notification of life-threatening conditions: By 2022, 98 percent of surveyed IT decision-makers expect predictive analytics and early on notification for your life- threatening types of conditions, such as for example sepsis and hospital-obtained infection, will be delivered to clinicians cellular devices; and

7. Patients are aware of the benefits associated with clinical flexibility and becoming more active participants found in the delivery of their health care: Nearly all surveyed patients (77 percent) expressed positivity about clinician use of mobile systems to increase the quality of their attention.

Zebra commissioned three global research studies to better understand the purpose of technology found in acute health care hospitals. The surveys carried out together with research partners (Analysis Now, Lucid) focused on nursing managers, IT decision manufacturers and recently hospitalized individuals. Zebra's 2022 Hospital Perspective Study summarizes the results of this evaluation and compiles the responses from over 1,500 respondents over the USA, Brazil, China, UK, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, with a diverse range of involvement and perspectives on healthcare delivery. The surveys were conducted in 2017.

# Smartphone Apps Help Clients and Suppliers Manage Atrial Fibrillation

My AF and AF Manager applications share patient data to increase face-to-face time.

October 19, 2017 - Novel smartphone and tablet applications for atrial fibrillation patients and healthcare pros have been launched simply by heart experts. The targets and style of the apps happen to be outlined in a paper posted online in EP Europace, one with an overview posted in the European Heart Journal.

Atrial fibrillation is going to be the most common heart rhythm disorder and drastically increases the threat of stroke and death. One in four middle-aged parents in European countries and the U.S. will establish atrial fibrillation, and the incidence and prevalence happen to be rising.

"Around two-thirds of people on Europe and the U.S. possess a cell device and put it to use simply because their main method of accessing online info," said lead author Dipak Kotecha, MbChB, Ph.D., a clinician scientist in cardiovascular drugs at the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Birmingham, U.K. this presents a major chance to improve self administration and shared decision producing in atrial fibrillation.

The My AF Iphone app and AF Manager Iphone app were created by the European Culture of Cardiology (ESC) Recommendations Task Pressure on Atrial Fibrillation and the CATCH Me personally consortium, of which the ESC is somebody. The software were developed during the last 2 years in tandem with the posting of the 2016 ESC Suggestions on atrial fibrillation.3

Both software are freely designed for Android and iOS gadgets through the Google Play and Apple stores.

My AF is for patients with atrial fibrillation. It offers information about the problem, the chance of stroke, atrial fibrillation procedures and tips on improving lifestyle. Clients can record symptoms and standard of living in a diary which may be distributed to a nominated health professional before each consultation to increase face-to-face time.

Developed in collaboration with affected individuals and patient support groups, My AF delivers high-quality information on a simple format which is well suited for adults of all ages. Work is definitely under-way to translate the application into several languages.

Kotecha said, "The Iphone app aims to encourage active patient involvement found in the control of their state. There is data that patient education can boost self-care, adherence to therapy and long-term outcomes."

AF Manager is for doctors, nurses and different healthcare professionals. It's the first application of its kind to come to be submitted for CE qualification and is in the final stages of authorization. AF Manager imports facts shared by the patient and allows the doctor to amend information and enter different medical info, such as for example electrocardiogram or echocardiography info. The Treatment Manager program within the app in that case suggests individualized treatment options predicated on ESC guidelines.4 After an appointment, the notes, treatment decisions and medication dosages can be entered and then distributed to the patient.

"Many studies have shown that whenever clinicians follow guideline recommendations, patients own better outcomes," said Kotecha. "All of the decision supports AF Manager derive from ESC guidelines, hence we wish this will motivate guideline implementation. Patients could have the choice to anonymously donate their info that may enable us to determine the guideline adherence rate."

The apps are associated with allow transfer of data between patients and health care professionals with a secure server at the University of Birmingham, U.K. Clients control who can watch and edit their info. When info sharing is enabled, updates are synced on both apps. All shared info is usually encrypted and password covered.

Kotecha said, "He know that effective operations of atrial fibrillation is suitable for shared decision-making and we've created the applications in the expectation of facilitating this process. Sharing facts should save clinicians period and allow them to devote consultations to finding the right treatments."

He concluded, "the dynamic nature of this technology will allow us to change and update the features and articles to reflect responses from users, and also future variants of the ESC atrial fibrillation guidelines."
