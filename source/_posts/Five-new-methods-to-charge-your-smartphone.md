We all moan and groan about how precisely bad the battery lifestyle on our cell phones is. Then, we hold moaning when Apple slows it down slightly to make the battery last longer.

Pubs in the united kingdom experience stopped charging our phones, because they state it is a risk of security and wireless chargers are difficult to find and aren't themselves Wi-Fi which is, good, stupid.

So, listed below are five quirky answers to these problems in 2018.

# Attachable coat heater and power bank

The recent weather has certainly kept many of us coughing and sneezing, and it doesn't look like it's going away any time in the near future.

Anyway, before diverting right into a rant about Donald Trump and plastic containers, here's one way you can stay warm and concurrently charge up your phone.

It's called the Torch 2.0 lightweight coat heater. It really is designed to easily fit into the jacket of your selecting, and will be switched conveniently between jackets with the use of Velcro.

It is powered using a 6000mAh ability bank providing you up to four time of warmth off an individual charge. In addition, it has two further USB ports which will be appropriate for any smartphone.

# Telephone box workstations

Need to replenish your tech and answer emails, but don't want to be stuck in a noisy cafe at lunch? There is currently a solution.

A FRESH York-based co-working company, Bar Works recently transformed many of the UK's underused but iconic red public phone booths into micro-offices for personnel on the go.

The project premiered in London, Leeds, Plymouth and Edinburgh as a more private option to co-working spaces and cafe offices.

The business retrofitted each phone box with Wi-Fi in addition to a printer, scanner, wireless mouse, 25-inch display screen, hot drinks equipment and power outlets, all for $9.99 a month.

At start, Bar Works CEO Jonathan Dark coloured said: "Your solution maximises the area, and we have a solution for security and membership-only access alongside the other problem of people using the area for too much time."

However, it seems to be the case that the CEO of Bar Gets results is simple fact one Renwick Haddow, who previously ran the Capital Alternatives network of corporations, which the High Court ruled in 2014 to be "collective expenditure schemes which could not be lawfully operated by the defendants" in line with the Financial Conduct Authority. Additionally there is, reportedly, some doubt as to whether Jonathan Dark is truly a person.

# Disposable charger

We're all been there - desperately closing applications and lowering brightness in a futile work to save battery for the journey home after a night out.

The simple plug-in disposable charger, PowerHit, which works together with both Apple & most Android gadgets (Type C USB not currently supported), is being retailed at £3. The business claims that it can produce up to two extra time of charge.

Before you get your hopes up, it is vital to notice that your phone should be on for the charger to do the job and this isn't disclosed by the product manufacturer on often its website or the packaging.

And more worryingly even now, remember Donald Trump and plastic containers? Add this one to the set of Ecological disasters.

# Bedside lamp wireless charger

Consequently, you finally got the hands on the new iPhone X, but have finally realised presently there isn't enough space on your bedside table for a radio charger. There's you don't need to worry.

Ikea and other companies have worked hard in recent years to include Qi charging technology into household furniture and everyday items, such as a bedside lamp.

As well as enabling you to fee your unit wireless, it provides yet another USB port to help you charge several devices simultaneously. Ikea's supplying retails at £49.

If you don't have an iPhone X, but like the lamp, the retailer also markets Vitahult wireless charging covers which make your phone Qi charging compatible and should keep your phone from cracking in case you accidently knock it off your brand-new bedside lamp.

# Smartphone with an enormous battery

You didn't buy a case for your phone. You're running right through the house 1 day, trip over your dog, fall and property right on your phone, smashing it to portions. Fortunately, you wished to get a new one in any case, one that doesn't go out of charge in a few hours.

This new offering from a Chinese phone manufacturer might be the one for you personally.

The Oukitel K10000 is powered by a 10000mAh battery with the capacity of increasing to 21, yes 21 days on a single charge with modest usage. The phone also permits you to charge other devices, possibly supporting some smaller notebook computers.

It also sports a good 5.5? FHD Display, a fingerprint reader, dual-zoom lens cams (13MP+5MP), runs Android 7.0 and has different rather impressive specifications and all from $65.99.

It is however just a little on the chunky area (it's huge, actually) and Oukitel isn't an extremely well-known brand, so you will see some clear scepticism, but stop being snobs.

And understand that you can acquire five of the for the cost of the iPhone X but still have money left for an attachable coat heater, 10 disposable chargers, that amazing wireless-charging lamp that you will certainly not be in a position to use because your new phone/phones don't support wireless charging, but who cares, and perhaps even a month's access to your unique micro office, which you might have to hang on a time for.

# Verdict

Stop moaning! Work with a normal charger and plug it into a socket many times during the day like the majority of normal people do.
